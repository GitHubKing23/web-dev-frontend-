They tried working with a GPU rental platform (similar to RunPod), which allowed them to:

- Generate automated visual mockups on demand  
- Automate headline and tagline suggestions using AI  
- Deliver twice as many client concepts without hiring more designers  

**Results in 3 months:**  
- ⏱ **50% faster content turnaround times**  
- 📈 **20% growth in client projects completed**  
- 💵 **30% increase in revenue per project**

> “We didn't invest in hardware—we just rented GPU time. It was seamless and drove real growth.”
