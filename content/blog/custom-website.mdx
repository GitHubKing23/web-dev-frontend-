### 🚫 The Cookie-Cutter Trap

Many small businesses start with DIY website builders. While fast and cheap, these platforms come with limitations:
- 🐌 Slow loading times  
- 📦 Generic templates that don’t stand out  
- 🔍 Limited SEO flexibility  
- 🧱 Hard-to-scale architecture  

Eventually, you outgrow the template and hit walls when trying to integrate new features.
